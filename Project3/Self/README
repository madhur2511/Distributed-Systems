Usage:
Run ./run.sh from a Docker terminal followed by the path to input text file, or leave it blank to run the default text file instead.


Components:

1. Mapper
The mapper does the simple task of reading a line of text from the file split
given to it and emits bigrams as key-value pairs, with the key being the
bigram and the value being 1.

Here, punctuations are not handled any differently than other characters,
which might result in difference in the final results obtained, although it
shouldn't be too high (approx 10% max)

2. Reducer
The reducer reads and sums all the values corresponding to a key and writes it
into the output file designated in the map-reduce task.

3. Post-processing
Process the sorted histogram of bigrams obtained from the map-reduce phase to:
1. Get the total number of bigrams
2. Get the most common bigram
3. Get top 10 percent contributors
